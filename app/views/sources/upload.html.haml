    Each file you select - you can pick as many as you like in the file dialog - will begin to upload immediately. To add more to the queue, just click 'add files to upload queue' again.
    When each upload is complete, you'll see a compact description form for that file: fill in a better title and short description so that you don't forget which is which.
    You can queue files and submit the description forms without interrupting the other uploads, but you mustn't close this page until they're all complete.
