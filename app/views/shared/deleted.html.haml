      Would you like to recover it? This will also recover all of its associated objects, taggings and discussions.

  .contentblock

      These are the immediate children that would be recovered with this object: 
      %strong
      = @thing.retrievable_associates_summary
  
  %div{:class => "contentblock mildwarning"}
    %p
      To remove this - and its associates - altogether, click the 'eliminate' button below. 
      It will disappear entirely from your collections and from your records. 
      You would normally only want to do this for duplicates.
      - form_for :thing, :url => {:action => 'eliminate', :id => @thing} do |f|

      Sorry: There is no

      here with the id 
      %strong<
        = params[:id]
      , and nothing in the trash either.
