EmailColumn
===========

This simple plugin does one thing, and tries to do it well - it validates emails. To use it, just:

  include EmailColumn

in a model class, and then you can say:

  email_column :email

to get spiffy validation on your email-toting column. The validation can also be used stand-alone:

  EmailColumn.valid?('asdf@example.com')

Enjoy!
