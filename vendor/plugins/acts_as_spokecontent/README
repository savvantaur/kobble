ActsAsSpokeContent
==================

This +acts_as+ extension consolidates common spoke functionality in one place for dryness. It defines three class methods:

acts_as_spoke
  creates the standard ownership and collection relations

acts_as_organised
  creates the scratchpad, tagging, flagging and discussion links that most objects enjoy

acts_as_illustrated
  creates the file_column columns for image and clip files

:only and :except parameters can be supplied, so eg:

  acts_as_organised :only => :tags
  acts_as_illustrated :except => :clip

the options are:

  acts_as_spoke: :collection, :creator, :updater
  acts_as_organised: :bundles, :scratchpads, :tags, :flags, :topics
  acts_as_illustrated: :clip, :image

by default all relations are created
