	<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Carol Russell</strong> Briefly, can you give me the headlines about your project?  What was it about?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p><strong>Matt Jackson</strong> The project itself was about looking at the future trends of the farming industry within England.  It was part of a bigger project, or programme, that was called Farm Regulation and Charging Strategy, which was about setting down how Government will work with farmers and delivery bodies to face the challenges ahead in the farming industry.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>How did it come about?  Why did you choose to do this?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>[1:00] There was quite a lot of research going on in different parts - evidence gathering.  A colleague and I realised that there was a gap in the forward-looking knowledge.  There was a lot of research on what was in existence, but there was a big gap in looking forward.  We went through the process of drawing up a job spec and engaged with a consultant putting it out to tender obviously.  We used this consultancy firm to take forward research on this area, which was very much forward-looking.  We kept it quite a tight spec as well so that we could really get out what we wanted to.  That was the main reason why we did it - so that we could actually use that then to balance out with the previous research we'd got so that we had a much better, fuller picture of what things were like now and where the farming industry was going.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>[2:00] What was a particularly high point for you in the project?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>There were quite a few actually.  The outcome was very interesting.  We had no idea really about what the actual outcome would be from this research project.  Government traditionally works in silos in some cases and will often look at the impact of regulation on their particularly sector, or one particularly regulation on a sector.  What hadn't happened before was this holistic approach to look at how all regulations joined together impact on one industry - in this case the farming industry.  That's holistic view was for me a high; it was the first time we'd sent his, so it was quite interesting.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Any others?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>The actual process of working it was a very short time-scale.  We knew this from the beginning.  We had about three of four weeks, and that was all to get the bulk of the work down.  The [3:00] working relationship we had between myself and my colleague as the policy leaders, the horizon scanning team, and the consultants worked very well.  We had a lot of open communications.  We were very clear on what we wanted.  We talked a lot to make sure that any misunderstandings were cleared up, that the English Farming and Food Partnership (EFFP) were clear on their direction, and that they felt very able to approach us or the horizon scanning team if they were unsure of anything.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Any more?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>The speed at which they delivered was very impressive.  There were a lot of subchapters to the actual final document - it's about 140 pages in total with annexes as well.  The way that they grabbed the project and ran with it very quickly and produced a lot of things, initially in draft, was very encouraging [4:00].</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>I picked up, and you're alluding to it now, in your 10-minute interview, that you said that barriers were nipped in the bud.  What were the barriers or the perceived barriers?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>It was more a case of if the job spec was looking slightly woolly in some places, we realised that to go down a particular route, or when other pressures came in from outside this project itself - because, as I said, it was part of a wider programme - there was lot of opportunity to go down various routes.  What we did quite early on was analyse whether this was a route worth going down.  Is it going to help the end result?  We were able to nip those in the bud either by making the decisions earlier on, cutting that off, or refocus.  At one point, we did have to refocus something [5:00].  We were looking at non regulatory drivers in the main, such as climate change, and <span class="caps">WTO</span> and energy prices, consumer food prices, consumer food choice and preferences, and new technology.  We were also looking at regulation because that was the main part of the overall programme on regulation and the charging strategy.  We realised that we didn't have enough time to do in-depth and well enough in both of those areas.  We left the regulation to one side because there was a lot of other work going on on that.  We focused on these non regulatory drivers, which meant that at the end, we could compare the impact of non-regulatory drivers to what regulation would do.  That really helped us to continue to define the project as well as develop it so that we would have a really good evidence and research base to work from, use, and share.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>I can see the sequence of events.  I'd like to feel the sequence of events if you know what I mean [6:00].  For example, that decision - what was it that actually drove that?  What triggered the need to say 'right, we've got enough stuff working on regulation.  Let's go for that'?  What was the thing that actually triggered it?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>It was me that actually made the decision and it was in quite a short timescale.  We talked about this as an added extra.  It was one of those strands that came along and the consultancy group <span class="caps">EFFP</span> had gone off and started to draft what how they would take it, which they gave back to me.  I then realised that it wasn't going to be enough for what we needed.  Also, they were saying that within the timescale, it might impact on the other drivers - the other chapters they were doing.  I took that decision so that we could really focus on what the bulk of the project was.  I knew from various bits of research that colleagues had done or collected over the year before [7:00] that we certainly had enough there to balance that out.  What we did in the end was we had a short paragraph that covered the overall picture, which gave us the link to link it into other research, which we then presented as a whole package at the end.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Thank you, that's really helpful for me to be able to see what drove what - what triggered what.  Were there any lows?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>There weren't any particularly lows.  The timing element was a worry and it could have been a low because it was such a short timescale, but it worked out.  Everyone involved did put in a lot of time.  It worked, but it was a concern.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Policy or strategy - whichever one.  How did what you [8:00] worked on affect policy and/or strategy?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>It's hopefully affected both.  Our overall document was a department of regulation strategy, so that really helped us to look again at what we'd got as a draft for the strategy and really define what we could put in there, and how we were going to have actions and success criteria to make sure that what we were saying we were doing with the strategy would actually meet the needs of what the farming industry was going to look like over the next 10 years.  It was a strategy for 10-15 years.  Having this forward-looking element was for me a crucial part of being able to write something that would last 10 15 years.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Excellent.</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>Hopefully, it's helped other policy around the department.  What we did is we shared this information.  It's on the website, but we didn't just stick it on the website and leave it; we talked to a lot of policy teams around the department.  We got the consultants in and we went to talk to industry as well [9:00] and said 'this is what we've come up with.  This is what we think has happened.  We've got this projection of where the poultry industry is going to go in 10 years.  These are all the different regulations that area going to impact on it for better or for worse.  These are the other drivers'.  You can see that the result we found was that regulation was only going to have a minor impact compared to other drivers around the world like climate change and consumer food choices and the drivers I mentioned earlier.  It was really helpful for us to share that and get people talking and thinking which meant that when they broke their policy and went back to their policies, they would actually have this knowledge and be able to think more about what's going to happen.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Because you are part of the strategy team, and in a way you commissioned this piece of horizon scanning and futures research, how [10:00] important do you think that is and why, from your point of view?  To be part of that process as opposed to someone coming to you with the information saying 'I think we've found this'?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>I've been different people in your scenario.  For me, it's really interesting to see the different stages and be the different people.  I hadn't been this person before.  I hadn't been in the position before where I was really in control of the commissioning and the decision-making part of the policy hold of that piece of research.  It's really interesting for me to see'  And I can think back to when I've been the person receiving the final report, or someone being [11:00] questioned about the report, our researchers also asked various policy people what they thought about a particular segment of the industry.  I've been in that place before.  To actually be the person driving it was very interesting for me.  I can look back and see if I were in someone else's shoes what I would do differently.  It also helped me to remember when I was a person being receiving information how I felt then, so I could really tailor what I was delivering back to them.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Thank you.  That was kind of what I was hoping you were going to say.  From way out here, with no experience at all, it felt like that.</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p><strong>Victoria Ward</strong> I wanted to ask about the farmers - those stakeholders.  What difference do you think it has made to them [12:00] or what engagement have you had with them where this piece of research has been able to play a role?</p>


  	<p>This research itself was obviously part of the bigger strategy that we were producing.  I don't know what direct impact this research will have.  However, it was a significant part of forming the overall strategy, which was launched at the end of November last year.  We have lots of commitments in that which farmers and industry bodies as well - National Farmers Union or the British Egg[?] Industry Council - will actually see the benefit at some point.  As it's a 10-15 year strategy, not all of the action points will be achievable within the first six months.  It's something that the department at Defra will be held accountable to.  We shared this with our stakeholders and with industry, and so they can now hit us over the head with it [13:00] if you like that expression.  We have this published document that we're accountable for.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> Can I dig a little deeper on that?  Is there something about the way this piece of research is able to contextualise regulation by saying non-regulation and regulation; look at the context here, which has allowed you to approach those people differently in some way?</p>


  	<p>I think it's given us a better idea and  a better picture about where regulation fits in to the wider world.  From a farmer's perspective, and we talked to them as well, they viewed whether it was a vet coming onto their farm, whether it was the Environment Agency, whether it was someone from the Rural Payments Agency; they viewed everyone as Government - even insurance schemes which are supermarket schemes.  It made us think about joining up what we are delivering and also [14:00] thinking from the farmer's perspective about how the other non-regulatory drivers impacted on them and how we can try to work more with that.  So, by linking into any work on the World Trade Organisation for example, and trying to push from our part in Defra to have much more cohesion and a much more coherent approach in the way we manage and talk to stakeholders so that when we're talking about climate change on the one hand, we can actually join it up with what we're doing on a particularly regulation that's going to impact on the farmers.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> So it allows humans in some way to connect the big context with the personal consequences for them?  I don't want to push it too far, but does this piece of research make it easier to show those connections?</p>


  	<p>It helps in the one industry.  It's only forward-looking, and it's on the non-regulatory drivers, so it gives us a lever we can use.  It gives us evidence [15:00] we can use so that when we go to other policies, it's something that we can use and draw on.  My current work is on sustainable development which is about economic, environment, and social elements, and looking at the impacts of those on policy, people and farmers.  I will be able to go back and draw on the evidence and the research in this project and actually use that when I work with other policy teams in looking at how their policy is impacting.  It's that joining up; looking and using this as evidence, and looking at the social and environmental impacts, and economic impacts.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> If you were advising someone else on commissioning a piece of horizon scanning [16:00] and futures work - from anywhere in Defra - from the policy side, what would your advice be to them from your direct experience?</p>


  	<p>My main advice would be the communications element - it would be dialogue.  There is an element of discussion and debate, but I think it's about dialogue with the people who are doing the research for you, with your end customer base, whether that's policy or stakeholders or whatever, making sure that you're getting out of it what you want to hear or what discuss further - what the actual purpose is.  For me, that communication was a crucial element.  Also, what I think it important, not least important, is the spec that you start off with; knowing in your mind and being clear about where you're going with this and what your boundaries are.  I think having boundaries is quite important to make sure that you don't get into the woolly areas or the various strands that I mentioned earlier.  That can be very interesting [17:00] and that can be quite a nice thing to do, to go off on a little tangent.  But in some cases, especially if you're very time limited as we were, it can have the risk of watering down the bulk of the evidence that you're gathering.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> Staying in the spec, which I was going to come back to as well, is there a particularly way that you went about that?  Specifically how you went about the spec and the to-ing and fro-ing around it, and the mixture of meetings and writing and drafting, email, dialogue'?</p>


  	<p>We had initial discussions within our area and our directorate about what we wanted to get out.  I mentioned at the very beginning that we'd identified the gap in evidence.  That was our key driver to start off with.  We talked about what we wanted to get out of it, and then we used the horizon scanning team and their specific experience and knowledge to help us really define what we were doing and really define what we were doing and really make it something that would be worthwhile for us and for them.  We had a couple of meetings with the horizon scanning team and [18:00] other people around the department who were later on going to do similar or related projects.  So we talked to the horizon scanning team about what research, evidence, and data they already had.  As this was such a short timescale, we knew we couldn't go off and do a whole lot of data collection.  We talked to them about what they had and that was key to actually progressing at such a quick speed.  We could point the consultants to the set of data that they had to really help them analyse it and take forward.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> So it actually started with a very clear gap, dialogue between you to identify what you wanted, and then honing that with the horizon scanning team and using what they had as available resources, and then a continuous triangular dynamic after that.</p>


  	<p>Yes, exactly.  Triangular is quite good: the consultants, horizons scanning, and us.  We were all involved in it; we all saw the drafts.  I think it was weekly or fortnightly [19:00] meetings with all of us together so we could chew over what we've got, go through the drafts, look at it from the bigger picture.  The consultants obviously had two, three, four people writing different chapters.  We wanted to make sure we were'  Whether it's language being analogous[sic] throughout or whether they're actually focusing on the same parts of the chapter.  Those weekly and fortnightly meetings were very helpful.  We could all bring along our own experience, whether it was us from the policy side, or the horizon scanning team with their knowledge.  Also, the consultancy firm had quite a good in-depth knowledge about agriculture.  That was keeping that dialogue open.  A lot of it as well was email.  It wasn't practical to meet every other day, and that would have been a waste of time I think.  If we met too frequently, I think there can be the tendency to talk around issues and not actually get to the nub of things.  Some of the barriers you mentioned earlier [20:00] - nipping them in the bud.  Email's a good way of putting things down clearly in bullet points.  If it's something like 'change this in paragraph 2.4' or 'this needs to be expanded in 7.5'.  It's a combination of different forms of communication; dialogue, face-to-face meetings, email, and telephone conversations.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> That's a really useful, practical description of the process.  I just want to spend a little more time staying there.  <span class="caps">EFFP</span> clearly have the right personality as a supplier to work well in that environment.  Is there anything you want to describe about the way they worked and the personalities on their team that contributed to the effectiveness of this.</p>


  	<p>I hadn't worked with the before, so this is the first time I've worked with them.  I think they were ver driven.  There was one person in particularly, David Ovalsop[?], who was our main contact.  He was the project manager on this piece of research.  He was our main contact, but there was another lady [21:00], Charlotte Lewof[?] who was there as well and came along to the meetings.  I think they were very driven.  They made sure that they had a clear understanding of what we wanted.  They weren't afraid to ask questions.  They weren't afraid to challenge what we were asking them to do to make sre we'd actually got it right - for our benefit.  We were very much the same.  We were challenging them.  'Is this actually the assumption you've come to.  You've put this as an assumption, but judging from the data you've got, the data and the projections, is that really what we think will happen?'  I think that sort of open, friendly challenging was very helpful.  The personalities involved, the individuals, very much lent towards that challenge.  I can see in different situations people might not like that so much.  They might be too reticent, or feel threatened.  I think the actually individual personalities we had around that worked very well.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> In terms of the methods that they used, was there anything about their research method that's worth noting [22:00]?</p>


  	<p>What they did to start with was they got a lot of the work done in draft, which I think was very helpful.  It gave us early on'  I think within the first two weeks we had a sort of rough draft of what was going on.  What they started to do, and what they were planning to do.  That was very helpful for us.  It helped us to see where they were going; were they on the right track?  Did they need to be pulled back on track?  That was very helpful for us.  If I were to do something again, I would do that, definitely.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> You'd say that kind of raw way of working, rather than polished, is a benefit?</p>


  	<p>I think so, from that specific project.  In another situation, it might not be.  If they had gone down the polished route, they could have come up with two or three perfectly polished chapters but they we wouldn't have seen'  There were10 chapters in total, so with the other seven chapters we would have been less sure on how they [23:00] were actually progressing.  You can assume, if you've got three perfectly polished ones, that they will continue, but we might have started focusing on three and forgot the other seven.  They did quite a good draft to start off with.  Then they built them up; they started to build the climate change one first I think, and Charlotte was working on that one.  That gave us an early indication of how the finished product for each chapter would look like - how it was being developed.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> That's really interesting.  Is that way of working comfortable in the Defra environment for different kinds of policy groups?  I'm trying to find the cultural edge here.</p>


  	<p>The thing I've found with Defra in my four or five posts here is that there are a lot of different working practices; there are a lot of different working cultures across the department, as we mentioned in the lift on the way up; Defra is only five years old.  We came from two different departments which had different working cultures anyway, and people have come from different departments with their own working cultures [24:00].  It would work well for some and not for others.  For us, it did have a dimension of anxiety I suppose, if you don't have anything finished until rather late on.  For me, it meant that we had a better idea of where the whole project was going.  We could see its direction, but not the actual finished project.  I can see that some people won't be as comfortable with that. People like to have things clear and finished upfront, but I think that worked well.  It was perhaps a risk that we wouldn't get anything polished by the end, but because of the way we were working'  Keeping that dialogue open, talking, communication, really focusing on looking at having a timeline of when we expected drafts by so that we could get our draft before the recess, which was our timescale which we knew would not move.  [25:00] Having that sort of programme/project management element was good and was very helpful.  
  Carol Russell[?]
  That's very helpful.  Just to be clear, I'm right in saying that there was no steering committee for this piece of work, but for the whole body of it?</p>


  	<p>Yes, that's right, for the programme there was a steering committee for the actual strategy itself.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> Did the steering committee play an active role at any stage within this piece of research, or was it very much self-contained?</p>


  	<p>They took the holistic view to the actual strategy.  This was one of 12 pieces of research - others were a lot smaller - going on.  So they were informed about it and we had a sub-committee - the one I mentioned - where we had presentations with policy teams from actual industries; so the person who sponsored the dairy industry, and the beef and sheep industries.  Then we had a separate one with stakeholders from the actual industry side [26:00].  We did have people and elements feeding in to the development.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> That sounds incredibly well orchestrated with the right tightness and the right looseness.  I really like the story that you've told.  Coming back to you personally, and what you've learned from it, in what you're doing now, what lessons have you carried forward in the work you're doing now?  If you wouldn't mind just describing that?</p>


  	<p>The planning element was very helpful.  Also, thinking about where things fitted into the timescale, the communications element definitely - that's something I am doing.  Dialogue; talking to people, finding out what they think; even if it's getting them to explain in their own words what they're doing and what the project's about.  That understanding and empathy, as well as the actual people you are delivering it for.  It's both inward and outward looking as well.  I think actually the process of being on [27:00] that side of the person who commissioned the research, although I haven't got any research to commission at the moment, it will be very helpful in the future to have been through that process.</p>


  	<p><strong>[VW]</strong> If you were to think about one thing that you personally are proudest of, what would it be?</p>


  	<p>Within this project?  It sounds a little but selfish, but it was that decision I made on cutting out that one strand.  My line manager who I was working on the project with was on holiday for two weeks.  That cropped up, and it was a risk to cut it out.  I didn't know if senior managers were actually going to like that, or if it was going to weaken the overall research.  But I used my knowledge of what had gone on so far, looked at the other existing evidence as well [28:00] and made that decision.  It was the right decision; I'm sure of that now.  I'm actually quite proud of that.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>What made you choose, or what helped you to choose the consultants that you chose?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>We had three tenders.  We put the tender out and had three responses, and we looked at how they viewed the scope.  Obviously, cost has an impact as well.  They very clearly understood what it was ll about.  They'd got the right background and obviously, it was a good quote as well.  They made us really feel that they'd grasped it and could run with it, and were also flexible because government changes even in [29:00] a short timescale.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Would you say that was because you were quite clear about what it was that you wanted, so it was easy to choose form three responses?</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>I think so, but I don't want to give you the impression that our job spec was crystal clear.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>I'm not getting that.</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>Actually having in our minds and on paper what it was all about - the big picture - was very helpful.  I think if we'd just gone in and said 'this is what we want you to do', that wouldn't have been very helpful.  Actually putting in the context made it easier for us to pick and for them to actually demonstrate their capabilities.</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>That's what I was driving for.  What object [30:00]'  Oh, he's got one!</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>I'm not sure if it was actually supposed to be from Defra, but this was half of my secret Santa from work, so it is relevant to the' It's a camping survival kit.  The other half of my secret Santa was a sheep which doesn't lend itself to good symbolism.  This is survival; you don't know what's going to happen in the future, and it helps you prepare for what's coming ahead; what's coming down the pipeline.  I thought this really summed up what the actual project was about; it was forward looking, it was looking at what could happen in the future, what impacts things will have, and the actual research in the end gave us the tool - as this is a tool - to best face what's ahead, and the challenges [31:00].</p>


  	<blockquote>
  		<p>Excellent.  Some other people have also offered metaphors as well as objects of their impression of how the work felt.</p>
  	</blockquote>


  	<p>The only one I'd link in is probably something like a walk in the country where you've got the path, and there are other little bridal ways or tracks and you can go off them at any time, but you've got your map with you, you know where you're heading, and you know where you're going.</p>


  	<p></strong>[VW]* Excellent.  Thank you very much, Matt [32:00].</p>

  <p>*Carol Russell* Briefly, can you give me the headlines about your project?  What was it about?
  <br />*Matt Jackson* The project itself was about looking at the future trends of the farming industry within England.  It was part of a bigger project, or programme, that was called Farm Regulation and Charging Strategy, which was about setting down how Government will work with farmers and delivery bodies to face the challenges ahead in the farming industry.  </p>

  <p>bq. How did it come about?  Why did you choose to do this?</p>

  <p>[1:00] There was quite a lot of research going on in different parts - evidence gathering.  A colleague and I realised that there was a gap in the forward-looking knowledge.  There was a lot of research on what was in existence, but there was a big gap in looking forward.  We went through the process of drawing up a job spec and engaged with a consultant putting it out to tender obviously.  We used this consultancy firm to take forward research on this area, which was very much forward-looking.  We kept it quite a tight spec as well so that we could really get out what we wanted to.  That was the main reason why we did it - so that we could actually use that then to balance out with the previous research we'd got so that we had a much better, fuller picture of what things were like now and where the farming industry was going.  </p>

  <p>bq. [2:00] What was a particularly high point for you in the project?</p>

  <p>There were quite a few actually.  The outcome was very interesting.  We had no idea really about what the actual outcome would be from this research project.  Government traditionally works in silos in some cases and will often look at the impact of regulation on their particularly sector, or one particularly regulation on a sector.  What hadn't happened before was this holistic approach to look at how all regulations joined together impact on one industry - in this case the farming industry.  That's holistic view was for me a high; it was the first time we'd sent his, so it was quite interesting.  </p>

  <p>bq. Any others?</p>

  <p>The actual process of working it was a very short time-scale.  We knew this from the beginning.  We had about three of four weeks, and that was all to get the bulk of the work down.  The [3:00] working relationship we had between myself and my colleague as the policy leaders, the horizon scanning team, and the consultants worked very well.  We had a lot of open communications.  We were very clear on what we wanted.  We talked a lot to make sure that any misunderstandings were cleared up, that the English Farming and Food Partnership (EFFP) were clear on their direction, and that they felt very able to approach us or the horizon scanning team if they were unsure of anything.  </p>

  <p>bq. Any more?</p>

  <p>The speed at which they delivered was very impressive.  There were a lot of subchapters to the actual final document - it's about 140 pages in total with annexes as well.  The way that they grabbed the project and ran with it very quickly and produced a lot of things, initially in draft, was very encouraging [4:00]. </p>

  <p>bq. I picked up, and you're alluding to it now, in your 10-minute interview, that you said that barriers were nipped in the bud.  What were the barriers or the perceived barriers?</p>

  <p>It was more a case of if the job spec was looking slightly woolly in some places, we realised that to go down a particular route, or when other pressures came in from outside this project itself - because, as I said, it was part of a wider programme - there was lot of opportunity to go down various routes.  What we did quite early on was analyse whether this was a route worth going down.  Is it going to help the end result?  We were able to nip those in the bud either by making the decisions earlier on, cutting that off, or refocus.  At one point, we did have to refocus something [5:00].  We were looking at non regulatory drivers in the main, such as climate change, and WTO and energy prices, consumer food prices, consumer food choice and preferences, and new technology.  We were also looking at regulation because that was the main part of the overall programme on regulation and the charging strategy.  We realised that we didn't have enough time to do in-depth and well enough in both of those areas.  We left the regulation to one side because there was a lot of other work going on on that.  We focused on these non regulatory drivers, which meant that at the end, we could compare the impact of non-regulatory drivers to what regulation would do.  That really helped us to continue to define the project as well as develop it so that we would have a really good evidence and research base to work from, use, and share.</p>

  <p>bq. I can see the sequence of events.  I'd like to feel the sequence of events if you know what I mean [6:00].  For example, that decision - what was it that actually drove that?  What triggered the need to say 'right, we've got enough stuff working on regulation.  Let's go for that'?  What was the thing that actually triggered it?  </p>

  <p>It was me that actually made the decision and it was in quite a short timescale.  We talked about this as an added extra.  It was one of those strands that came along and the consultancy group EFFP had gone off and started to draft what how they would take it, which they gave back to me.  I then realised that it wasn't going to be enough for what we needed.  Also, they were saying that within the timescale, it might impact on the other drivers - the other chapters they were doing.  I took that decision so that we could really focus on what the bulk of the project was.  I knew from various bits of research that colleagues had done or collected over the year before [7:00] that we certainly had enough there to balance that out.  What we did in the end was we had a short paragraph that covered the overall picture, which gave us the link to link it into other research, which we then presented as a whole package at the end.  </p>

  <p>bq. Thank you, that's really helpful for me to be able to see what drove what - what triggered what.  Were there any lows?</p>

  <p>There weren't any particularly lows.  The timing element was a worry and it could have been a low because it was such a short timescale, but it worked out.  Everyone involved did put in a lot of time.  It worked, but it was a concern.  </p>

  <p>bq. Policy or strategy - whichever one.  How did what you [8:00] worked on affect policy and/or strategy?</p>

  <p>It's hopefully affected both.  Our overall document was a department of regulation strategy, so that really helped us to look again at what we'd got as a draft for the strategy and really define what we could put in there, and how we were going to have actions and success criteria to make sure that what we were saying we were doing with the strategy would actually meet the needs of what the farming industry was going to look like over the next 10 years.  It was a strategy for 10-15 years.  Having this forward-looking element was for me a crucial part of being able to write something that would last 10 15 years. </p>

  <p>bq. Excellent.</p>

  <p>Hopefully, it's helped other policy around the department.  What we did is we shared this information.  It's on the website, but we didn't just stick it on the website and leave it; we talked to a lot of policy teams around the department.  We got the consultants in and we went to talk to industry as well [9:00] and said 'this is what we've come up with.  This is what we think has happened.  We've got this projection of where the poultry industry is going to go in 10 years.  These are all the different regulations that area going to impact on it for better or for worse.  These are the other drivers'.  You can see that the result we found was that regulation was only going to have a minor impact compared to other drivers around the world like climate change and consumer food choices and the drivers I mentioned earlier.  It was really helpful for us to share that and get people talking and thinking which meant that when they broke their policy and went back to their policies, they would actually have this knowledge and be able to think more about what's going to happen.</p>

  <p>bq. Because you are part of the strategy team, and in a way you commissioned this piece of horizon scanning and futures research, how [10:00] important do you think that is and why, from your point of view?  To be part of that process as opposed to someone coming to you with the information saying 'I think we've found this'?</p>

  <p>I've been different people in your scenario.  For me, it's really interesting to see the different stages and be the different people.  I hadn't been this person before.  I hadn't been in the position before where I was really in control of the commissioning and the decision-making part of the policy hold of that piece of research.  It's really interesting for me to see'  And I can think back to when I've been the person receiving the final report, or someone being [11:00] questioned about the report, our researchers also asked various policy people what they thought about a particular segment of the industry.  I've been in that place before.  To actually be the person driving it was very interesting for me.  I can look back and see if I were in someone else's shoes what I would do differently.  It also helped me to remember when I was a person being receiving information how I felt then, so I could really tailor what I was delivering back to them.</p>

  <p>bq. Thank you.  That was kind of what I was hoping you were going to say.  From way out here, with no experience at all, it felt like that.  </p>

  <p>*Victoria Ward* I wanted to ask about the farmers - those stakeholders.  What difference do you think it has made to them [12:00] or what engagement have you had with them where this piece of research has been able to play a role?</p>

  <p>This research itself was obviously part of the bigger strategy that we were producing.  I don't know what direct impact this research will have.  However, it was a significant part of forming the overall strategy, which was launched at the end of November last year.  We have lots of commitments in that which farmers and industry bodies as well - National Farmers Union or the British Egg[?] Industry Council - will actually see the benefit at some point.  As it's a 10-15 year strategy, not all of the action points will be achievable within the first six months.  It's something that the department at Defra will be held accountable to.  We shared this with our stakeholders and with industry, and so they can now hit us over the head with it [13:00] if you like that expression.  We have this published document that we're accountable for.</p>

  <p>*[VW]* Can I dig a little deeper on that?  Is there something about the way this piece of research is able to contextualise regulation by saying non-regulation and regulation; look at the context here, which has allowed you to approach those people differently in some way?</p>

  <p>I think it's given us a better idea and  a better picture about where regulation fits in to the wider world.  From a farmer's perspective, and we talked to them as well, they viewed whether it was a vet coming onto their farm, whether it was the Environment Agency, whether it was someone from the Rural Payments Agency; they viewed everyone as Government - even insurance schemes which are supermarket schemes.  It made us think about joining up what we are delivering and also [14:00] thinking from the farmer's perspective about how the other non-regulatory drivers impacted on them and how we can try to work more with that.  So, by linking into any work on the World Trade Organisation for example, and trying to push from our part in Defra to have much more cohesion and a much more coherent approach in the way we manage and talk to stakeholders so that when we're talking about climate change on the one hand, we can actually join it up with what we're doing on a particularly regulation that's going to impact on the farmers.</p>

  <p>*[VW]* So it allows humans in some way to connect the big context with the personal consequences for them?  I don't want to push it too far, but does this piece of research make it easier to show those connections?</p>

  <p>It helps in the one industry.  It's only forward-looking, and it's on the non-regulatory drivers, so it gives us a lever we can use.  It gives us evidence [15:00] we can use so that when we go to other policies, it's something that we can use and draw on.  My current work is on sustainable development which is about economic, environment, and social elements, and looking at the impacts of those on policy, people and farmers.  I will be able to go back and draw on the evidence and the research in this project and actually use that when I work with other policy teams in looking at how their policy is impacting.  It's that joining up; looking and using this as evidence, and looking at the social and environmental impacts, and economic impacts.</p>

  <p>*[VW]* If you were advising someone else on commissioning a piece of horizon scanning [16:00] and futures work - from anywhere in Defra - from the policy side, what would your advice be to them from your direct experience?</p>

  <p>My main advice would be the communications element - it would be dialogue.  There is an element of discussion and debate, but I think it's about dialogue with the people who are doing the research for you, with your end customer base, whether that's policy or stakeholders or whatever, making sure that you're getting out of it what you want to hear or what discuss further - what the actual purpose is.  For me, that communication was a crucial element.  Also, what I think it important, not least important, is the spec that you start off with; knowing in your mind and being clear about where you're going with this and what your boundaries are.  I think having boundaries is quite important to make sure that you don't get into the woolly areas or the various strands that I mentioned earlier.  That can be very interesting [17:00] and that can be quite a nice thing to do, to go off on a little tangent.  But in some cases, especially if you're very time limited as we were, it can have the risk of watering down the bulk of the evidence that you're gathering. </p>

  <p>*[VW]* Staying in the spec, which I was going to come back to as well, is there a particularly way that you went about that?  Specifically how you went about the spec and the to-ing and fro-ing around it, and the mixture of meetings and writing and drafting, email, dialogue'?</p>

  <p>We had initial discussions within our area and our directorate about what we wanted to get out.  I mentioned at the very beginning that we'd identified the gap in evidence.  That was our key driver to start off with.  We talked about what we wanted to get out of it, and then we used the horizon scanning team and their specific experience and knowledge to help us really define what we were doing and really define what we were doing and really make it something that would be worthwhile for us and for them.  We had a couple of meetings with the horizon scanning team and [18:00] other people around the department who were later on going to do similar or related projects.  So we talked to the horizon scanning team about what research, evidence, and data they already had.  As this was such a short timescale, we knew we couldn't go off and do a whole lot of data collection.  We talked to them about what they had and that was key to actually progressing at such a quick speed.  We could point the consultants to the set of data that they had to really help them analyse it and take forward.</p>

  <p>*[VW]* So it actually started with a very clear gap, dialogue between you to identify what you wanted, and then honing that with the horizon scanning team and using what they had as available resources, and then a continuous triangular dynamic after that. </p>

  <p>Yes, exactly.  Triangular is quite good: the consultants, horizons scanning, and us.  We were all involved in it; we all saw the drafts.  I think it was weekly or fortnightly [19:00] meetings with all of us together so we could chew over what we've got, go through the drafts, look at it from the bigger picture.  The consultants obviously had two, three, four people writing different chapters.  We wanted to make sure we were'  Whether it's language being analogous[sic] throughout or whether they're actually focusing on the same parts of the chapter.  Those weekly and fortnightly meetings were very helpful.  We could all bring along our own experience, whether it was us from the policy side, or the horizon scanning team with their knowledge.  Also, the consultancy firm had quite a good in-depth knowledge about agriculture.  That was keeping that dialogue open.  A lot of it as well was email.  It wasn't practical to meet every other day, and that would have been a waste of time I think.  If we met too frequently, I think there can be the tendency to talk around issues and not actually get to the nub of things.  Some of the barriers you mentioned earlier [20:00] - nipping them in the bud.  Email's a good way of putting things down clearly in bullet points.  If it's something like 'change this in paragraph 2.4' or 'this needs to be expanded in 7.5'.  It's a combination of different forms of communication; dialogue, face-to-face meetings, email, and telephone conversations.  </p>

  <p>*[VW]* That's a really useful, practical description of the process.  I just want to spend a little more time staying there.  EFFP clearly have the right personality as a supplier to work well in that environment.  Is there anything you want to describe about the way they worked and the personalities on their team that contributed to the effectiveness of this. </p>

  <p>I hadn't worked with the before, so this is the first time I've worked with them.  I think they were ver driven.  There was one person in particularly, David Ovalsop[?], who was our main contact.  He was the project manager on this piece of research.  He was our main contact, but there was another lady [21:00], Charlotte Lewof[?] who was there as well and came along to the meetings.  I think they were very driven.  They made sure that they had a clear understanding of what we wanted.  They weren't afraid to ask questions.  They weren't afraid to challenge what we were asking them to do to make sre we'd actually got it right - for our benefit.  We were very much the same.  We were challenging them.  'Is this actually the assumption you've come to.  You've put this as an assumption, but judging from the data you've got, the data and the projections, is that really what we think will happen?'  I think that sort of open, friendly challenging was very helpful.  The personalities involved, the individuals, very much lent towards that challenge.  I can see in different situations people might not like that so much.  They might be too reticent, or feel threatened.  I think the actually individual personalities we had around that worked very well.</p>

  <p>*[VW]* In terms of the methods that they used, was there anything about their research method that's worth noting [22:00]?</p>

  <p>What they did to start with was they got a lot of the work done in draft, which I think was very helpful.  It gave us early on'  I think within the first two weeks we had a sort of rough draft of what was going on.  What they started to do, and what they were planning to do.  That was very helpful for us.  It helped us to see where they were going; were they on the right track?  Did they need to be pulled back on track?  That was very helpful for us.  If I were to do something again, I would do that, definitely.</p>

  <p>*[VW]* You'd say that kind of raw way of working, rather than polished, is a benefit?</p>

  <p>I think so, from that specific project.  In another situation, it might not be.  If they had gone down the polished route, they could have come up with two or three perfectly polished chapters but they we wouldn't have seen'  There were10 chapters in total, so with the other seven chapters we would have been less sure on how they [23:00] were actually progressing.  You can assume, if you've got three perfectly polished ones, that they will continue, but we might have started focusing on three and forgot the other seven.  They did quite a good draft to start off with.  Then they built them up; they started to build the climate change one first I think, and Charlotte was working on that one.  That gave us an early indication of how the finished product for each chapter would look like - how it was being developed.  </p>

  <p>*[VW]* That's really interesting.  Is that way of working comfortable in the Defra environment for different kinds of policy groups?  I'm trying to find the cultural edge here. </p>

  <p>The thing I've found with Defra in my four or five posts here is that there are a lot of different working practices; there are a lot of different working cultures across the department, as we mentioned in the lift on the way up; Defra is only five years old.  We came from two different departments which had different working cultures anyway, and people have come from different departments with their own working cultures [24:00].  It would work well for some and not for others.  For us, it did have a dimension of anxiety I suppose, if you don't have anything finished until rather late on.  For me, it meant that we had a better idea of where the whole project was going.  We could see its direction, but not the actual finished project.  I can see that some people won't be as comfortable with that. People like to have things clear and finished upfront, but I think that worked well.  It was perhaps a risk that we wouldn't get anything polished by the end, but because of the way we were working'  Keeping that dialogue open, talking, communication, really focusing on looking at having a timeline of when we expected drafts by so that we could get our draft before the recess, which was our timescale which we knew would not move.  [25:00] Having that sort of programme/project management element was good and was very helpful.  
  <br />Carol Russell[?]
  <br />That's very helpful.  Just to be clear, I'm right in saying that there was no steering committee for this piece of work, but for the whole body of it?</p>

  <p>Yes, that's right, for the programme there was a steering committee for the actual strategy itself. </p>

  <p>*[VW]* Did the steering committee play an active role at any stage within this piece of research, or was it very much self-contained?  </p>

  <p>They took the holistic view to the actual strategy.  This was one of 12 pieces of research - others were a lot smaller - going on.  So they were informed about it and we had a sub-committee - the one I mentioned - where we had presentations with policy teams from actual industries; so the person who sponsored the dairy industry, and the beef and sheep industries.  Then we had a separate one with stakeholders from the actual industry side [26:00].  We did have people and elements feeding in to the development.  </p>

  <p>*[VW]* That sounds incredibly well orchestrated with the right tightness and the right looseness.  I really like the story that you've told.  Coming back to you personally, and what you've learned from it, in what you're doing now, what lessons have you carried forward in the work you're doing now?  If you wouldn't mind just describing that?</p>

  <p>The planning element was very helpful.  Also, thinking about where things fitted into the timescale, the communications element definitely - that's something I am doing.  Dialogue; talking to people, finding out what they think; even if it's getting them to explain in their own words what they're doing and what the project's about.  That understanding and empathy, as well as the actual people you are delivering it for.  It's both inward and outward looking as well.  I think actually the process of being on [27:00] that side of the person who commissioned the research, although I haven't got any research to commission at the moment, it will be very helpful in the future to have been through that process. </p>

  <p>*[VW]* If you were to think about one thing that you personally are proudest of, what would it be?</p>

  <p>Within this project?  It sounds a little but selfish, but it was that decision I made on cutting out that one strand.  My line manager who I was working on the project with was on holiday for two weeks.  That cropped up, and it was a risk to cut it out.  I didn't know if senior managers were actually going to like that, or if it was going to weaken the overall research.  But I used my knowledge of what had gone on so far, looked at the other existing evidence as well [28:00] and made that decision.  It was the right decision; I'm sure of that now.  I'm actually quite proud of that.</p>

  <p>bq. What made you choose, or what helped you to choose the consultants that you chose?</p>

  <p>We had three tenders.  We put the tender out and had three responses, and we looked at how they viewed the scope.  Obviously, cost has an impact as well.  They very clearly understood what it was ll about.  They'd got the right background and obviously, it was a good quote as well.  They made us really feel that they'd grasped it and could run with it, and were also flexible because government changes even in [29:00] a short timescale.  </p>

  <p>bq. Would you say that was because you were quite clear about what it was that you wanted, so it was easy to choose form three responses?</p>

  <p>I think so, but I don't want to give you the impression that our job spec was crystal clear.</p>

  <p>bq. I'm not getting that.</p>

  <p>Actually having in our minds and on paper what it was all about - the big picture - was very helpful.  I think if we'd just gone in and said 'this is what we want you to do', that wouldn't have been very helpful.  Actually putting in the context made it easier for us to pick and for them to actually demonstrate their capabilities.  </p>

  <p>bq. That's what I was driving for.  What object [30:00]'  Oh, he's got one! </p>

  <p>I'm not sure if it was actually supposed to be from Defra, but this was half of my secret Santa from work, so it is relevant to the' It's a camping survival kit.  The other half of my secret Santa was a sheep which doesn't lend itself to good symbolism.  This is survival; you don't know what's going to happen in the future, and it helps you prepare for what's coming ahead; what's coming down the pipeline.  I thought this really summed up what the actual project was about; it was forward looking, it was looking at what could happen in the future, what impacts things will have, and the actual research in the end gave us the tool - as this is a tool - to best face what's ahead, and the challenges [31:00].  </p>

  <p>bq. Excellent.  Some other people have also offered metaphors as well as objects of their impression of how the work felt.</p>

  <p>The only one I'd link in is probably something like a walk in the country where you've got the path, and there are other little bridal ways or tracks and you can go off them at any time, but you've got your map with you, you know where you're heading, and you know where you're going. </p>

  <p>*[VW]* Excellent.  Thank you very much, Matt [32:00].
